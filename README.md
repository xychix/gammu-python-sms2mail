The `gammu-python-sms2mail` script
========================

A simple tool/script based on 
['gammu-python'](http://wammu.eu/news/2015/05/12/python-gammu-2-2/)
Reads all sms, emails them and deletes them. Plain and simple, no
advanced error checking. Might be a nice start for bigger projects.
was build with python-gammu 1.33.0-3 and a huawei e173 dongle.

Prerequisites
-------------
This script might work if you have gammu-python installed and have gammu
working. eg. You need a working config that unlocks the sim pin and identifies
the device.

-----

By default, `gammu-python-sms2mail` requires that (a) you have a valid 
`/etc/gammurc` file (or symbolic link) present in your local filesystem, 
and (b) that `/etc/gammurc` provides a working phone/modem configuration in 
its `gammu`section. Here's a simple example:

```
[gammu]
Connection = at
Device = /dev/ttyUSB0

```

Cronjob
-------
Starting the script using a cronjob works fine. The init takes a while. Maybe
building a loop that polls the device every 20 seconds is more efficient. Will do
that later.

```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* *  *   *   *     /home/yourusername/bin/sms2mail.py
```

offcourse the file needs to be in the proper location and I've found that you'd
need to put the gammu config in the same dir as the python script in such a setup.
